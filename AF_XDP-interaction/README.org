#+Title: How to transfer info from XDP-prog to AF_XDP

This BPF-example show how use BTF to create a communication channel
between XDP-prog (running kernel-side) and AF_XDP user-space process.

* AF_XDP documentation

When developing your AF_XDP application, we recommend familiarising
yourself with the core AF_XDP concepts, by reading the kernel
[[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/af_xdp.html][documentation for AF_XDP]]. And XDP-tools also contain documentation in
[[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools/blob/master/lib/libxdp/README.org#using-af_xdp-sockets][libxdp for AF_XDP]], explaining how to use the API, and the difference
between the control-path and data-path APIs.

It is particularly important to understand the *four different
ring-queues* which are all Single-Producer Single-Consumer (SPSC)
ring-queues. A set of these four queues are needed *for each queue*
on the network device (netdev).
